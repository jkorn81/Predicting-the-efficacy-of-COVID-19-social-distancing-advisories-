The first dataset is collected from Google's Community Mobiltiy Reports at https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/. The Github contains three main folders labeled Google.Report.Extraction, Merged.Data, Modeling. Google.Report.Extraction folder contains folders labeled code, data, and two generated xlsx files containing the extracted data from Google's reports. Within the code folder is two R scripts to conduct two tasks. The first is completed by the R script labeled pdf.download, which downloads the current Google Community Mobility Reports pdf files from the website and stores them in your local machine in a directory labeled /data. The second task is completed by the R script labeled pdf.import which imports the pdf files, converts them into a list of texts, and then uses regular expressions to extract various data points from the texts to create the two generated xlsx files labeled data.xlsx and data.us.xlsx. 

        - data.xlsx contains all countries and US states. 
        - data.us.xlsx is a subset of data.xlsx only including the US states. 

The final dataset is created by merging data.us.xlsx with various other US reports including the CDC, FBI, etc. Merged.Data folder contains code and xlsx or csv files of for the final merged data utilized for modeling. Sources of the data include:

Modeling contains a folder labeled code containing R scripts to perform OLS and Random Forest on the final dataset and recreate the results from the study.
